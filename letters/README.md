this code was actually written by [Jetty Nimoy](http://jtnimoy.com/) for her article [Creative Code Yourself Out of a Box](https://medium.com/@jtnimoy/creative-code-yourself-out-of-a-box-a18a51a3a5b2). it's a fantastic article, and i highly recommend it! 

the code here generates a design i really like, so i saved it to make it my own later
